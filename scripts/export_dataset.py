**Snapshot date:** {today} · **Open jobs:** {len(jobs)} · **Companies:** {stats['companies']} · **License:** CC BY 4.0

Live job postings in the iGaming industry (online casino, sports betting, game studios, affiliates,
payments, compliance) aggregated by [SpinHire](https://spinhire.io) from employer career pages, ATS feeds
and public channels. The index is refreshed every 6 hours; jobs that disappear at the source are archived.
This dataset is a point-in-time export of the public API (`https://spinhire.io/api/jobs`).

## Files

- `jobs.csv` / `jobs.jsonl` — one row per open job: title, company, location, country, work format,
  department, salary (raw string plus parsed min/max/currency/unit when the employer published it),
  employment type, working languages, tags, posting and expiry dates, SpinHire URL and the original posting URL.
- `market_monthly.csv` — open jobs at month end, hiring companies, new postings and the share with a
  published salary, reconstructed from each job's open/close dates. Source: https://spinhire.io/market
- `market_daily.csv` — daily snapshots stored from September 2026.

## Notes

- Only about 5% of iGaming employers publish a salary in the posting; `salary_min`/`salary_max` are empty otherwise.
- `country` is derived from the free-text location; `Remote` is a separate category.
- No job descriptions, contact details or personal data are included.
- Countries, departments (`category`) and work formats are exported in English (`/api/jobs?lang=en`).
